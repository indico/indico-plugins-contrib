# OpenAPI

Read-only REST API for Indico resources, described with an OpenAPI v3 document.

The API reuses Indico's own request handlers, marshmallow schemas and access
checks, so a request returns exactly the data the authenticated user can see in
the web interface. Objects a user cannot access are omitted from lists instead
of being reported as an error.

## Pagination

List endpoints take `limit` and `offset` and answer with an envelope:

```json
{
    "results": [],
    "count": 0,
    "next_offset": null
}
```

`next_offset` is the value to send as `offset` to get the next page, or `null`
on the last one. It counts rows scanned rather than results returned, because
rows the user cannot access are skipped without being listed.

## Authentication

Swagger UI authenticates with your Indico session cookie, so nothing needs to
be filled in there. From outside, create a personal token under your Indico
profile with the `read:everything` scope and send it as a bearer token:

```sh
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer indp_...' https://indico.example.com/api/v1/events/1
```

Indico rejects a request that carries a token and a session cookie at the same
time, so never send both.
